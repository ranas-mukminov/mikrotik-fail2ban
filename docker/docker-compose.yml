# Notes:
# 
# 1. DOCKER-USER chain vs INPUT chain:
#    - Fail2Ban typically adds rules to the INPUT chain
#    - For Docker host protection, ensure rules are in INPUT or DOCKER-USER
#    - With network_mode: host, INPUT chain rules work as expected
#    - Without host network, you may need custom actions targeting DOCKER-USER
#
# 2. MikroTik Configuration:
#    Configure your MikroTik router to send logs to this container:
#    /system logging action add name=remote target=remote remote=YOUR_DOCKER_HOST_IP remote-port=514
#    /system logging add topics=system,info,error action=remote
#
# 3. Custom Configurations:
#    - Create ./data/filter.d/ with custom *.conf files to override filters
#    - Create ./data/jail.d/ with custom *.conf files to override jails
#    - Create ./data/action.d/ with custom *.conf files for MikroTik API actions
#
# 4. Testing:
#    - Build: docker-compose build
#    - Start: docker-compose up -d
#    - Logs: docker-compose logs -f
#    - Status: docker-compose exec fail2ban fail2ban-client status
#
# 5. Security:
#    - Never expose port 514 to the internet without proper firewall rules
#    - Use encrypted syslog (TLS) in production if possible
#    - Consider using a dedicated network for log collection
